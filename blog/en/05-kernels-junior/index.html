<h3>🍜 The lunch break</h3>
<p>This was one of the office weeks.<br/>
I was already at the cafeteria table, watching a status notification fade on my phone, when Kernel walked in.<br/>
Same calm stride.<br/>
Same unreadable focus.<br/>
Except today, he had company.<br/>
He stopped beside the table, as if he’d almost forgotten something important, then stepped aside.<br/>
“Novi,” he said. “This is Flip.”<br/>
Flip smiled immediately. Too immediately.<br/>
“Hi. I’m Flip. I joined Kernel’s team this week.”<br/>
He nodded once. Then again, just to be safe.<br/>
“Sit,” I said, before he could choose the wrong option.<br/>
Kernel took his usual seat — back to the wall, facing outward, posture already in meeting mode.<br/>
Flip sat next to him.<br/>
Not across.<br/>
Not diagonally.<br/>
Next.<br/>
That told me enough.</p>
<p>Flip started talking. Freshers always do.<br/>
College. Interests. Excitement. The thrill of finally seeing real production code.<br/>
Kernel listened.<br/>
Didn’t interrupt.<br/>
Didn’t nod.<br/>
Didn’t confirm that reality, in fact, existed.<br/>
I helped.<br/>
“So,” I said, “first in-office week treating you well?”<br/>
Flip laughed. Fast.<br/>
“Yes! I mean — it’s great. There’s a lot to learn. Kernel’s codebase is… very disciplined.”<br/>
Kernel took a sip of water.<br/>
Disciplined, to him, was not praise.<br/>
It was the minimum.<br/>
Flip glanced at Kernel. Then back at me.<br/>
“I mean,” he said, lowering his voice, “even small changes feel… visible.”<br/>
Kernel said nothing.<br/>
I smiled. “That’s usually a good sign. It means the system is awake.”<br/>
Flip nodded. His shoulders stayed tense.<br/>
The silence wasn’t awkward.<br/>
It was observant.<br/>
Kernel broke it.<br/>
“Flip worked on a helper module this morning.”<br/>
Flip straightened.<br/>
“I fixed it,” he said quickly. “The issue. I mean. It was minor. I rolled it back. I just thought—”<br/>
“You shouldn’t have touched it yet.”<br/>
Kernel’s voice didn’t change.<br/>
Flip froze.<br/>
Not at the correction.<br/>
At the yet.<br/>
“You’ll get there,” Kernel added. “Just not today.”<br/>
That was all.<br/>
Kernel returned to his lunch.<br/>
Flip smiled. The muscles engaged. The confidence didn’t.<br/>
Kernel’s watch vibrated. He stood.<br/>
“Meeting,” he said. “Finish up.”<br/>
Then, almost casually, to Flip: “Next time, get it reviewed before pushing to main.”<br/>
And he was gone.<br/>
Flip watched him leave.<br/>
Didn’t speak for a moment.<br/>
Then, softly: “He’s… strict.”<br/>
Not angry.<br/>
Not accusing.<br/>
Just slightly compressed.<br/>
I stirred my coffee.<br/>
“He is.”<br/>
Flip exhaled. Relieved. “Right? I mean, it was a small change. Easy to roll back.”<br/>
I looked at him.<br/>
“At this stage,” I said, “small changes are allowed.”<br/>
Flip blinked. “Allowed?”<br/>
“Yes,” I said. “Just not everywhere.”<br/>
He frowned, like the question was forming — and then quietly archived itself.<br/>
It wasn’t really about the change.<br/>
It rarely is.</p>
<h3>👀 Flip Finds Me</h3>
<p>Flip found me the way juniors always do.<br/>
Not by asking.<br/>
By hovering.<br/>
I was refilling my coffee when he appeared at the counter, studying the sugar packets like they held architectural secrets.<br/>
“Hey,” he said. Casual. Too casual.<br/>
“Quick question.”<br/>
It never was.<br/>
“Sure,” I said. Coffee makes me generous.<br/>
He leaned in slightly. Not invading space. Just borrowing confidence.<br/>
“So… Kernel mentioned not pushing directly to main.”<br/>
I nodded. “He usually does.”<br/>
“Right. Obviously. Makes sense.” A pause.<br/>
“I was just wondering if there are… exceptions?”<br/>
There it was.<br/>
Not rebellion.<br/>
Negotiation.<br/>
I stirred my coffee. Let the silence work.<br/>
“Exceptions exist,” I said. “They announce themselves. Loudly. With consequences.”<br/>
Flip laughed. Polite.<br/>
Then quieter, “Yeah. That tracks.”<br/>
He didn’t leave.<br/>
Instead, he walked with me back to my desk.<br/>
That’s how I knew this wasn’t about Git.<br/>
After that, Flip started appearing.<br/>
Not dramatically.<br/>
Just… correctly timed.<br/>
If I was reviewing a PR, he’d be nearby.<br/>
If I was sketching in my notebook, he’d lean over.<br/>
“I like how you think about edge cases,” he said once.<br/>
Flattering.<br/>
Also wrong.<br/>
I mostly think about why things fail at 2 a.m.<br/>
One afternoon, he asked, “Does Kernel ever say ‘good job’?”<br/>
I didn’t answer.<br/>
I asked, “Did he correct your code today?”<br/>
“Twice.”<br/>
I smiled. “Then you’re fine.”<br/>
Flip didn’t smile back.<br/>
“In front of the seniors,” he added.<br/>
Ah.<br/>
I looked at him properly.<br/>
He wasn’t angry.<br/>
Just compressed.</p>
<p>Later, during a long build, he sat across from me.<br/>
Spun his chair. Stopped. Corrected the angle.<br/>
“I know he’s not wrong,” Flip said.<br/>
“I just thought I’d do better. Faster.”<br/>
“You will.”<br/>
“But—”<br/>
“I didn’t say but.”<br/>
He exhaled. “It just feels like it’s never enough.”<br/>
I kept my eyes on my screen.<br/>
“Kernel doesn’t measure effort,” I said.<br/>
“He measures impact.”<br/>
Flip frowned. “That’s worse.”<br/>
“Only if you’re collecting approval instead of skill.”<br/>
That landed.<br/>
Then, softer: “I don’t want to disappoint him.”<br/>
That one stuck.<br/>
I turned toward him.<br/>
“Kernel doesn’t waste disappointment on people he doesn’t care about.”<br/>
Flip blinked. “He cares?”<br/>
I shrugged. “He invests.”<br/>
Kernel walked past our row.<br/>
Didn’t stop.<br/>
Didn’t look.<br/>
Flip straightened instantly.<br/>
Kernel paused. Barely.<br/>
“Flip,” he said, without turning fully, “send the patch for review before EOD.”<br/>
“Yes,” Flip said.<br/>
Kernel left.<br/>
Flip sat back slowly.<br/>
”…See?” he said. “Strict.”<br/>
I took a sip of coffee.<br/>
“Consistent.”<br/>
Flip didn’t argue.<br/>
But he stayed.<br/>
And that again told me enough.</p>
<h3>💥 Thursday — The Push</h3>
<p>The mistake happened on a Thursday.<br/>
Thursdays are dangerous.<br/>
People feel efficient. Confidence inflates. Safeguards start looking optional.<br/>
Flip was working on a small fix. Genuinely small.<br/>
One function.<br/>
One file.<br/>
One line that looked so harmless it almost asked to be trusted.<br/>
He ran the tests.<br/>
Green. All of them.<br/>
He stared at the checks a little longer than necessary.<br/>
Then he skipped something.<br/>
Not because he didn’t know better.<br/>
Because he wanted to be fast.<br/>
He pushed.<br/>
Straight to main.<br/>
I noticed because the build went quiet.<br/>
Not loud-failure quiet.<br/>
The worse kind.<br/>
The something’s wrong but hasn’t decided how to scream yet quiet.<br/>
Kernel stood up.<br/>
No rush.<br/>
No drama.<br/>
Just the sound of a chair sliding back.<br/>
“Who pushed the last change?”<br/>
Flip raised his hand halfway.<br/>
Then committed.<br/>
“I did,” he said. “It was just a minor—”<br/>
Kernel lifted a hand.<br/>
Not angry.<br/>
Not loud.<br/>
“Why wasn’t this reviewed?”<br/>
Flip opened his mouth. Closed it.<br/>
“The tests passed,” he said finally. “And I thought—”<br/>
Kernel turned his screen.<br/>
“I didn’t ask what you thought,” he said.<br/>
“I asked what you skipped.”<br/>
The room froze.<br/>
Keyboards stopped sounding busy.<br/>
Monitors suddenly became fascinating.<br/>
Flip didn’t shrink physically.<br/>
Internally, though — I recognized the movement.<br/>
I tried. Why does it still feel like I failed?<br/>
Kernel continued, steady.<br/>
“Nothing goes to main without a review.”<br/>
Pause.<br/>
“Ever.”<br/>
Flip nodded. Too fast.<br/>
Kernel wasn’t done.<br/>
“This isn’t about bugs,” he said.<br/>
“It’s about trust.”<br/>
That landed harder than shouting would have.<br/>
Then Kernel looked up.<br/>
At me.<br/>
I was mid-sip of coffee. Naturally.<br/>
“And Novi,” he added, “if you’re helping, make sure you’re not accelerating him past process.”<br/>
Fair.<br/>
Painful.<br/>
Accurate.<br/>
We fixed it quietly.<br/>
Together.<br/>
Kernel explained what broke.<br/>
Flip listened. No interruptions this time.<br/>
No jokes.<br/>
No defenses.<br/>
When it was done, Kernel added one last thing: “Learn fast. Don’t outrun safeguards.”<br/>
Then he sat down.<br/>
Just like that.<br/>
Flip didn’t look at me right away.<br/>
When he did, his voice was lighter than his face.<br/>
“I guess he hates shortcuts.”<br/>
I turned toward him.<br/>
“No,” I said. “He hates surprises.”<br/>
Flip attempted a laugh.<br/>
It didn’t load.<br/>
He nodded instead.<br/>
And went back to his desk — carrying something heavier than a reverted commit.</p>
<h3>🌧️ The Aftermath</h3>
<p>Flip stopped sitting next to Kernel after that.<br/>
Not dramatically.<br/>
Not deliberately.<br/>
Just… one chair away.<br/>
Close enough to hear.<br/>
Far enough to breathe.<br/>
He started showing up at my desk instead.<br/>
At first, it sounded accidental.<br/>
“Hey Novi, quick question.”<br/>
Then useful.<br/>
“Can I run this by you?”<br/>
Then routine.<br/>
“I just want a second opinion.”<br/>
He never said why.<br/>
He didn’t have to.<br/>
Kernel, meanwhile, changed nothing.<br/>
Which was the problem.<br/>
No raised voice.<br/>
No delayed coldness.<br/>
No visible disappointment.<br/>
Just corrections.<br/>
Precise. Immediate. Terminal.<br/>
Flip hated that more than scolding.<br/>
At least scolding meant reaction.<br/>
One afternoon, he dropped into the chair opposite me with a sigh that wanted witnesses.<br/>
“He doesn’t like me.”<br/>
I didn’t look up.<br/>
Silence makes people continue.<br/>
“He never says anything good,” Flip said.<br/>
“Not once.”<br/>
I scrolled.<br/>
“He only points out what’s wrong.”<br/>
Pause.<br/>
“He notices everything I mess up.”<br/>
That one stayed.<br/>
I looked at him then.<br/>
Kernel hadn’t called him careless.<br/>
Or slow.<br/>
Or unfit.<br/>
He had just… raised the bar.<br/>
Flip mistook expectation for rejection.<br/>
It happens often.<br/>
“I pushed a clean fix today,” Flip said quickly.<br/>
“Tests passed. No regressions. Even optimized the loop.”<br/>
“And?” I asked.<br/>
“And nothing,” he said.<br/>
“No ‘good job’. No ‘looks fine’. Just—”<br/>
He sliced the air.<br/>
“‘Next.’”<br/>
He laughed. Short. Pre-rehearsed.<br/>
“I mean, if I were that bad, just say it, right?”<br/>
That wasn’t humour.<br/>
I leaned back.<br/>
“Kernel doesn’t comment on things he trusts.”<br/>
Flip frowned. “That makes no sense.”<br/>
“It does if you watch where his attention goes,” I said.<br/>
“He stays where things can still break.”<br/>
Flip stared at his hands.<br/>
Then, quieter: “I just want to know if I’m… okay.”<br/>
There it was.<br/>
Not ego.<br/>
Not anger.<br/>
Calibration.<br/>
“You are,” I said. “But you’re asking the wrong signal.”<br/>
Flip looked up.<br/>
I gestured—not at Kernel, but at the empty space where he usually paused during reviews.<br/>
“Some people don’t say ‘good job,’” I said.<br/>
“They say ‘fix this’ when it’s broken, and nothing when it’s not.”<br/>
Flip blinked.<br/>
He didn’t argue.<br/>
He didn’t smile.<br/>
A notification pinged on my screen.<br/>
Flip stood.<br/>
“Sorry,” he said. “Didn’t mean to dump.”<br/>
He always apologized for taking space.<br/>
At the edge of the aisle, he added—casually, like it didn’t matter: “I just thought… if I did one thing really well, he’d notice.”<br/>
Then he left.<br/>
I watched him go.<br/>
A minute later, Kernel passed by, eyes on his tablet.<br/>
He slowed. Just a fraction.<br/>
Then moved on.<br/>
Flip didn’t see it.<br/>
But I did.<br/>
And for the first time, I wondered if Flip was trying to impress Kernel—<br/>
—or trying not to disappoint someone he couldn’t quite name.</p>
<h3>🚨 A Friday Evening — The Weight Appears</h3>
<p>Flip was supposed to be gone.<br/>
At lunch, he’d been excited — weekend trip, no laptop, freedom.<br/>
So, when I saw him late evening, bag on shoulder, still hovering near the cafeteria. Alone —<br/>
“Weren’t you leaving?” I asked.<br/>
Flip smiled. Too fast.<br/>
“I am,” he said. “I mean— I will.”<br/>
I nodded.<br/>
“Bag packed?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
Silence.<br/>
He stared at the coffee machine like it had personally disappointed him.<br/>
I waited.<br/>
“Did the trip get cancelled?” I asked.<br/>
“No.” Too quick.<br/>
Then, softer: “No. It’s still on.”<br/>
Another pause.<br/>
“Then why are you still here?”<br/>
He exhaled. Not anger. Not sadness. Something knotted.<br/>
“I’m about to leave,” he said.<br/>
His feet didn’t move.<br/>
I let the silence do another lap.<br/>
“Is this about Kernel?” I asked.<br/>
“Yes.<br/>
No.<br/>
Maybe.”<br/>
I stayed quiet.<br/>
That’s when Flip finally spoke.</p>
<h3>🤕 The Scrum Master’s Mistake (As Told by Flip)</h3>
<p>“It actually started last week,” Flip said.<br/>
“Thursday. Sprint planning.”<br/>
I turned toward him.<br/>
“The Scrum Master was locking the backlog,” he continued.<br/>
“Final priorities. Sprint goals. And Kernel—”<br/>
He paused.<br/>
“He said one of the stories didn’t make sense. The dependency. The requirement. Said it didn’t align with the sprint goal.”<br/>
I nodded. Kernel doing that tracked.<br/>
“And?”<br/>
“The Scrum Master said it was fine,” Flip said.<br/>
“Product Owner asked for it. We could clarify later.”<br/>
He gave a short laugh.<br/>
“So the board got locked. Sprint started. We worked all week.”<br/>
He inhaled.<br/>
“Today—Friday—the Product Owner joined the connect.”<br/>
I already knew the rest.<br/>
“And started asking,” Flip said quietly,<br/>
“why we were building this.”<br/>
He swallowed.<br/>
“Why this story. Why this feature. Why we spent days on something that doesn’t move the goal at all.”<br/>
I stayed still.<br/>
“Kernel pulled up the board,” Flip went on.<br/>
“Showed the sprint commitment. The locked backlog.”<br/>
His jaw tightened.<br/>
“But the Product Owner didn’t care how it happened,” he said.<br/>
“Just that it happened.”<br/>
I could hear the call. The pauses doing the damage.<br/>
“And the Scrum Master?” I asked.<br/>
Flip looked away.<br/>
“He didn’t say anything.”</p>
<h3>😖 Kernel Takes the Blame</h3>
<p>Flip’s voice dropped.<br/>
“And Kernel…”<br/>
“He didn’t point at anyone.”<br/>
Flip looked at me then, something sharp in his eyes.<br/>
“He just said, ‘We’ll fix it.’<br/>
Said we’d realign. Said it wouldn’t reach the client.”<br/>
I frowned. “The sprint ends Monday.”<br/>
Flip nodded.<br/>
“Which means—” He gestured around us.<br/>
The empty office. The late hour. The weekend standing nearby.<br/>
“After the call,” he said, “the seniors logged off.”<br/>
“Family stuff. Plans. ‘We’ll catch up Monday.’”<br/>
His hands tightened around his cup.<br/>
“And Kernel stayed.”</p>
<h3>😫 The Unfairness</h3>
<p>”Why does this bother you?” I asked.<br/>
“Because it’s unfair,” Flip said immediately.<br/>
I waited.<br/>
“He questioned the story,” Flip said.<br/>
“He didn’t lock the board.”<br/>
“He didn’t derail the sprint.”<br/>
His voice dipped—just a notch.<br/>
“And now he’s paying for it.”</p>
<h3>💡 My Explanation (MSB, LSB, Sign Bit)</h3>
<p>I stirred my coffee.<br/>
“Flip,” I said, “let’s do this properly. Systematically.”<br/>
He nodded.<br/>
“You know binary numbers?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
“Good. Then listen.”<br/>
“In binary,” I said, “not all bits are equal.”<br/>
I held my spoon in the air, like a pointer.<br/>
“The leftmost bit is called the Most Significant Bit — the MSB.<br/>
The rightmost is the Least Significant Bit — the LSB.”<br/>
I drew an invisible number between us.<br/>
“Take an 8-bit number.”<br/>
“If the 1 is at the far right—”<br/>
I tapped the table lightly.<br/>
“00000001<br/>
That means 1.”<br/>
I shifted my hand to the left.<br/>
“But move that same 1 to the far left—”<br/>
Another tap. Firmer.<br/>
“10000000<br/>
That means 128.”<br/>
Flip’s eyes widened.<br/>
“Same bit,” I said.<br/>
“Completely different weight.”<br/>
I let that settle.<br/>
“Errors near the LSB cause noise,” I continued.<br/>
“Rounding issues. Minor inaccuracies. The system survives.”<br/>
Then I tapped harder.<br/>
“Errors near the MSB change meaning.”<br/>
Flip leaned back.<br/>
“And in signed binary numbers,” I added,<br/>
“the MSB does more than setting magnitude.”<br/>
I looked at him.<br/>
“It decides direction.”<br/>
“One flipped bit,” I said,<br/>
“and +42 becomes -42.”<br/>
Flip exhaled slowly.<br/>
“That’s not small.”<br/>
“No,” I said. “That’s misdirection.”<br/>
I leaned back.<br/>
“Now here’s the part that matters.”<br/>
“An Agile team is a signed system.”<br/>
He stilled.<br/>
“The Scrum Master functions like the MSB with sign control,” I said.<br/>
“They lock direction. Sprint intent. Alignment.”<br/>
“When the wrong backlog was locked,” I continued,<br/>
“that wasn’t an LSB error.”<br/>
“That was a sign-bit error.”<br/>
Flip’s jaw tightened.<br/>
“And Kernel?” I said.<br/>
“He operates closest to that MSB.”<br/>
“When the Product Owner looked at the system,” I said quietly,<br/>
“the direction pointed to him.”<br/>
“At that level,” I added,<br/>
“you don’t defend ego.”<br/>
“You stabilize the system.”<br/>
I paused, then softened my voice.<br/>
“And you,” I said, “are closer to the LSB.”<br/>
He flinched. I raised a hand.<br/>
“That’s not an insult. That’s design.”<br/>
“Freshers are allowed to mess up sometimes,” I said.<br/>
“Your mistakes are expected to be visible, local, correctable.”<br/>
I met his eyes.<br/>
“You fail loudly. But the leads?<br/>
They fail quietly — so the system doesn’t.”<br/>
Flip didn’t speak.<br/>
He didn’t need to.<br/>
He wasn’t seeking approval anymore.<br/>
He was recalibrating.</p>
<h3>✨ The Choice</h3>
<p>We sat there for a long moment.<br/>
Then Flip checked his phone.<br/>
A message. Probably friends.<br/>
He exhaled.<br/>
“I should go,” he said.<br/>
I nodded. Didn’t stop him.<br/>
He took two steps toward the exit.<br/>
Stopped.<br/>
Turned back.<br/>
“Is he still there?”<br/>
“Yes.”<br/>
Flip nodded once.<br/>
He turned and walked toward the dev area.<br/>
I followed, curious.<br/>
Kernel was at his desk.<br/>
Screens glowing.<br/>
Alone.<br/>
Flip approached quietly.<br/>
Didn’t speak.<br/>
He pulled up a chair.<br/>
Kernel glanced sideways.<br/>
Said nothing.<br/>
Kept working.<br/>
After a moment, without looking up: “Want to say something?”<br/>
“Can I help?”<br/>
Kernel looked up.<br/>
“You didn’t have to.”<br/>
Flip swallowed.<br/>
“I know,” he said. “I wanted to.”<br/>
Kernel nodded once.<br/>
They worked in silence.<br/>
Not mentor.<br/>
Not junior.<br/>
Just two people fixing something that mattered.<br/>
I watched from a distance.<br/>
Some systems don’t change direction loudly.<br/>
They don’t announce it.<br/>
They just… align.<br/>
And sometimes, the smallest bit moves left.</p> </article> <nav class="max-w-3xl mx-auto py-12 px-4 sm:px-0 mt-8 border-t border-support-muted"> <div class="flex justify-between items-center gap-4"> <div class="w-1/3 flex justify-start"> <a href="/blog/en/04-kernels-uninvited-guest-part2" class="flex items-center text-sm font-medium text-accent-secondary hover:text-neutral-dark bg-neutral-light border border-support-muted hover:border-accent-secondary transition-all duration-200 p-3 rounded-lg"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-4 w-4 mr-2" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M15 19l-7-7 7-7"></path> </svg> <span class="font-bold">Chapter 4</span> </a> </div> <div class="w-1/3 flex justify-center"> <a href="/blog/en" class="flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-sm font-medium text-support-muted hover:text-accent-primary transition-colors duration-200"> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-6 w-6 mb-1" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M4 6a2 2 0 012-2h2a2 2 0 012 2v2a2 2 0 01-2 2H6a2 2 0 01-2-2V6zM14 6a2 2 0 012-2h2a2 2 0 012 2v2a2 2 0 01-2 2h-2a2 2 0 01-2-2V6zM4 16a2 2 0 012-2h2a2 2 0 012 2v2a2 2 0 01-2 2H6a2 2 0 01-2-2v-2zM14 16a2 2 0 012-2h2a2 2 0 012 2v2a2 2 0 01-2 2h-2a2 2 0 01-2-2v-2z"></path> </svg> <span>Archive</span> </a> </div> <div class="w-1/3 flex justify-end dark-layer"> <div class="flex items-center p-3 opacity-60 cursor-default select-none text-right"> <span class="text-sm font-medium text-support-muted mr-2">You're all caught up</span> <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="h-5 w-5 text-green-500" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"> <path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M9 12l2 2 4-4m6 2a9 9 0 11-18 0 9 9 0 0118 0z"></path> </svg> </div> </div> </div> </nav>  </main> <!-- 3.
