<h1>My Side Hustle Gave Me Real Hustle</h1>

<h2>😫 The Hard Stop</h2>

<p>
    Kernel isn't home today.<br/>
    That itself is a problem.<br/>
    Not because I can't function without him — I can.<br/>
    But when machines break, Kernel is the kind of person who can fix them easily.<br/>
    I am the kind of person who talks to them.
</p>

<p>
    This morning, I was stitching.<br/>
    Calm stitching.<br/>
    The good kind.<br/>
    The foot pedal kept a steady rhythm.<br/>
    The needle dipped in and out like it knew exactly where it belonged.<br/>
    Cotton thread pulled tight, then rested — like a breath taken at the right moment.
</p>

<p>
    These pouches matter.<br/>
    They're part of my premium branding service — hand-stitched, tactile, personal.<br/>
    The kind of thing people touch twice before putting away.
</p>

<p>
    A client wants exactly 100 of them for an event tomorrow morning.<br/>
    Not 98.<br/>
    Not "around a hundred."<br/>
    One. Zero. Zero.
</p>

<p>
    And then—<br/>
    The machine stopped.<br/>
    Not politely.<br/>
    Not with a warning sound.<br/>
    It jammed.
</p>

<p>
    The needle froze mid-dip, as if it had suddenly changed its mind about existence.<br/>
    The belt made a weak, offended noise.<br/>
    I reached for the hand wheel — my comfort — and it wouldn't move.
</p>

<p>
    I oiled it.<br/>
    Tapped it.<br/>
    Restarted it.<br/>
    Nothing.
</p>

<p>I stared at the half-stitched pouch trapped under the needle, like it had betrayed me personally.</p>

<p>
    That's when my phone rang.<br/>
    Client.<br/>
    "Just checking — everything is on track, right?"
</p>

<p>
    I looked at the unfinished stack beside me.<br/>
    Clean numbers are cruel.
</p>

<p>
    "Yes," I said.<br/>
    My voice sounded braver than my wrists felt.
</p>

<p>
    After the call, panic stopped being abstract.<br/>
    It became physical — tight fingers, shallow breath, the urge to shake the machine like it could be scared into cooperation.
</p>

<p>
    The local repair guy said,<br/>
    "Madam, this model is too old."
</p>

<p>
    Offline stores shook their heads.<br/>
    One shopkeeper smelled like grease and rust. He wiped his hands on a rag and said,<br/>
    "Parts are unavailable. We'll need to order them for manufacturing. Two to three weeks."
</p>

<p>
    Another didn't even hesitate.<br/>
    "Automatic only. No manual."
</p>

<p>
    One brightened briefly.<br/>
    "We have automatic with a manual handle. Default is automatic. You just pull this clutch before using."
</p>

<p>Tomorrow morning echoed in my head.</p>

<p>
    In the middle of all this, my phone rang again.<br/>
    Aunt Sonar.<br/>
    "Where are you? Your house is locked from outside," she said.<br/>
    "You remember you were supposed to give binary lessons to Codex and Enigma? They have an exam tomorrow. Hope you didn't forget."
</p>

<p>
    I had forgotten.<br/>
    Completely.
</p>

<p>If I didn't rush back home, Aunt Sonar would declare me unreliable — publicly, dramatically, and forever. Possibly with witnesses.</p>

<p>
    I went home.<br/>
    Settled the kids down.<br/>
    Aunt Sonar left, satisfied but suspicious.
</p>

<p>
    I opened my laptop and searched again, just in case.<br/>
    Delivery dates laughed out loud.<br/>
    Then suggested I relax.
</p>

<p>
    From the corner of the room, Enigma said,<br/>
    "We have a test on binary addition tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
    I sighed.<br/>
    Reluctantly, I pulled out my whiteboard.
</p>

<p>
    The machine was broken.<br/>
    The order was exact.<br/>
    Time had no sympathy.<br/>
    And somehow, I was about to teach binary addition.
</p>

<h2>👇 The Workaround Nobody Asked For</h2>

<p>
    I picked up the marker and faced the board.<br/>
    Half-hearted writing.<br/>
    The kind where the hand moves but the mind is still stuck somewhere else — under a jammed needle, inside a missed deadline.
</p>

<p>"The rules of binary addition," I said, more to the board than to the kids.</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    0 + 0 = 0 <br/>
    0 + 1 = 1 <br/>
    1 + 0 = 1 <br/>
    1 + 1 = 10
</div>

<p>"So if we need to add—"</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
&nbsp;&nbsp;110<br/>+ 111<br/>-------<br/>-------
</div>

<p>"Then—"</p>

<p>
    "Wait," Codex said.<br/>
    Not softly.<br/>
    "But in the book, it's written differently."
</p>

<p>
    That snapped me out of it.<br/>
    I turned. "Differently how?"
</p>

<p>
    He pushed the book toward me, finger already marking the page.<br/>
    There it was, printed confidently, like this was the proper way to think:
</p>

<p><strong>Conversion Method</strong></p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    Step 1: Binary → Decimal<br/>
    Step 2: Add<br/>
    Step 3: Decimal → Binary
</div>

<p>
    I stared at it for a second.<br/>>
    Then I wiped the board clean.<br/>>
    Not angrily.<br/>>
    Decisively.
</p>

<p>
    "Okay," I said, picking the marker up again.<br/>
    "Remember last week's lesson?"
</p>

<p>Both of them nodded.</p>

<p>
    "I already taught you this method then," I continued, writing as I spoke.<br/>
    "So this is not new. This is just using it."
</p>

<p>The board filled up again, slower this time.</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    110 = 1x2² + 1x2¹ + 0x2⁰ = 6<br/>
    111 = 1x2² + 1x2¹ + 1x2⁰ = 7
</div>

<p>"First you convert," I said.</p>
<p>"Then you add."</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    6 + 7 = 13
</div>

<p>"And then you convert back."</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    13 = 1101
</div>

<p>
    "That's it," I said.<br/>
    "That's what the book is doing."
</p>

<p>I stepped aside so they could see the whole thing at once.</p>

<p>
    "It's slower," I added, almost apologetically.<br/>
    "But it works."
</p>

<p>
    I tore a page from my notebook and slid it toward them.<br/>
    "Do a few on your own," I said.<br/>
    "Use the same steps. Convert, add, convert back."
</p>

<p>
    The room went quiet except for pencil scratches and whispered powers of two.<br/>
    I leaned against the table.<br/>
    And somewhere between <strong>6 + 7 = 13 and 13 = 1101</strong>, another voice slipped in.
</p>

<p>
    The shopkeeper.<br/>
    "Default is automatic. You just need to pull this clutch."
</p>

<p>
    I looked at the board again.<br/>
    Not elegant.<br/>
    Not direct.<br/>
    But usable.
</p>

<p>
    I checked the time.<br/>
    Tomorrow morning.<br/>
    Exactly 100.
</p>

<p>
    I grabbed my bag.<br/>
    "Keep practicing," I said, already moving toward the door.<br/>
    "I'll be back."
</p>

<p>
    I wasn't fixing the old machine.<br/>
    I was going to buy the one that would work.
</p>

<h2>⚡Back in Motion</h2>

<p>
    I came straight back from the shop.<br/>
    No detours. No bargaining guilt. Just… bought it. Done.
</p>

<p>
    "Progress?" I asked, glancing at the kids.<br/>
    They nodded. Too quickly. Suspiciously.<br/>
    I didn't ask more. Not yet.
</p>

<p>
    First, the machine.<br/>
    I set it up. Checked the height. Foot pedal.<br/>
    Threaded it carefully — top spool, tension discs, take-up lever, needle eye.<br/>
    Bobbin in. Plate closed.
</p>

<p>
    The motor hummed.<br/>
    Sweet, normal hum.<br/>
    Not the old one, but close enough.
</p>

<p>I stitched a test piece.</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    ✔ Stitch quality<br/>
    ✔ Accuracy<br/>
    ✔ Familiarity
</div>

<p>
    For a moment, the day unclenched.<br/>
    Okay. Delivery looks possible again. I exhaled.
</p>

<p>Back to the pouches. Stitching resumed.</p>
<p>Immediately… wrists hurt.</p>

<p>
    Every time I need to sew, I have to switch it to manual mode. Pull the clutch. Then pedal.<br/>
    Pull clutch. Pedal.<br/>
    Pull clutch. Pedal.
</p>

<p>
    My wrists felt like they were being counted out in binary — one pain, zero relief.<br/>
    Rhythm broke.<br/>
    Pace uneven.<br/>
    Time slipping through my fingers like it had somewhere better to go.
</p>

<p>
    I'm correct.<br/>
    I'm producing.<br/>
    I'm also… exhausted.
</p>

<p>
    I paused. Stretched my fingers. Thought: maybe check the kids.<br/>
    They're still at the table. Pencils scratching. Not much movement.
</p>

<p>
    "How many done?" I asked.<br/>
    Silence.<br/>
    Codex mumbled, "Four."
</p>

<p>
    "Four… in an hour?"<br/>
    It sounded like a question. It wasn't meant to.
</p>

<p>
    Enigma sighed. "Numbers are large."<br/>
    Codex added, "Conversion is taking time."
</p>

<p>
    I looked at the page. Stuck on the fifth question.<br/>
    I rubbed my forehead.<br/>
    They were correct.<br/>
    But slow.<br/>
    Exhausting — for them and for me.
</p>

<h2>🤓 The Direct Way</h2>

<p>
    I picked up the notebook.<br/>
    Checked the work.<br/>
    Everything was correct.<br/>
    Six-digit, seven-digit numbers. Painfully correct.
</p>

<p>
    I shook my head.<br/>
    "Okay," I said, "can I teach you a better method?"
</p>

<p>
    Codex stiffened immediately.<br/>
    "But it's not in the syllabus."
</p>

<p>"It will be faster," I said.</p>

<p>
    Enigma frowned.<br/>
    "But it will be difficult. Exam is tomorrow."
</p>

<p>
    I paused.<br/>
    Then said, slowly,<br/>
    "What if I tell you… it's not new?"
</p>

<p>They looked at me.</p>

<p>"What if I say you already know it?"</p>

<p>Silence.</p>

<p>
    "It's the same maths you've been doing in decimal," I said.<br/>
    "Nothing extra. Just realised differently."
</p>

<p>
    I pulled the whiteboard closer.<br/>
    "Forget conversion for a moment. Just add."
</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
&nbsp;&nbsp;110<br/>+ 111<br/>-------<br/>-------
</div>

<p>
    "Start from the right. Same as always."<br/>
    I pointed. "0 + 1 = 1."<br/>
    I wrote 1.
</p>

<p>
    "Next column. 1 + 1 = ?"
</p>

<p>They both replied, "2"</p>
<p>"In decimal, yes. In binary, we can't write 2."</p>

<p>So, I wrote:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
1 + 1 = 0<br/>
carry 1
</div>

<p>
    "Same rule as 8 + 7 = 15. You write 5, carry 1."<br/>
    I drew the carry above the next column.
</p>

<p>
    "Now add everything in this column."<br/>
    "1 (carry) + 1 + 1 = 3."
</p>

<p>They paused.</p>
<p>"In binary," I continued, "3 is written as 11."</p>

<p>I wrote:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
1 + 1 + 1 = 1<br/>
</div>

<p><strong>"Write 1. Carry 1 again."</strong></p>
<p>I moved to the next column.</p>
<p>"Now we only have the carry."</p>
<p>"1."</p>

<p>I completed the addition:</p>
<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
&nbsp;&nbsp;110<br/>+ 111<br/>------<br/>&nbsp;1101
</div>

<p>
    "No conversion," I said.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    Codex stared at the board.<br/>
    "So, carry keeps moving… until it finishes?"
</p>

<p>
    "Yes," I said.<br/>
    "Exactly like decimal."
</p>

<p>
    Enigma leaned closer.<br/>
    "So binary addition is just column-wise addition, but carry rules change?"
</p>

<p>
    "Carry rules don't change," I corrected gently.<br/>
    "Only the base does."
</p>

<p>
    They sat back.<br/>
    This pause felt different.<br/>
    Not stuck.<br/>
    Settling.
</p>

<p>
    "Try the next one," I said.<br/>
    "Direct method only."
</p>

<p>
    Behind me, the machine hummed.<br/>
    In front of me, numbers finally moved faster.<br/>
    And this time, no one complained.
</p>

<h2>🤔 Same Reluctance</h2>

<p>
    I went back to the machine.<br/>
    Pull clutch.<br/>
    Pedal.<br/>
    Pull clutch again.<br/>
    Pedal.
</p>

<p>
    My wrists protested immediately.<br/>
    And that's when I noticed it.
</p>

<p>
    This feeling.<br/>
    This no, I'll manage it myself stubbornness.
</p>

<p>
    This is exactly what Codex and Enigma were doing.<br/>
    Not in the syllabus.<br/>
    Too late to learn.<br/>
    Tomorrow is the exam.
</p>

<p>I stood there for a second, hands still on the machine.</p>

<p>
    I'm not scared of the machine.
    I'm scared of letting it take over.<br/>
    Like I'll lose control if I let it run.
</p>

<p>Just like they felt about the direct method.</p>

<p>
    I stopped.<br/>
    Let my hands rest.<br/>
    Then — quietly — I switched to automatic.
</p>

<p>
    No announcement.<br/>
    No big decision sound.
</p>

<p>
    Pedal.<br/>
    The machine moved.<br/>
    Smooth. Even.<br/>
    Like it had been waiting for me to stop fighting it.
</p>

<p>
    I actually laughed.<br/>
    "Oh," I said to nobody, "so that's it."
</p>

<p>
    The stitches flowed. One after another.<br/>
    No breaks.<br/>
    No wrist pain.<br/>
    No interruptions.
</p>

<p>
    Behind me—<br/>
    "I finished one," Enigma said.<br/>
    "Me too," Codex said. "And it's correct."
</p>

<p>
    I didn't turn around.<br/>
    Didn't need to.<br/>
    Everything was moving now.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    That's when Aunt Sonar appeared at the door.<br/>
    She looked at the table.<br/>
    Then the machine.<br/>
    Then the kids.<br/>
</p>

<p>"Hm," she said. "Everyone seems busy."</p>

<p>
    I smiled.<br/>
    The machine hummed.<br/>
    The numbers flowed.<br/>
    No one was stuck.<br/>
</p>

<p>
    Nothing was finished yet.<br/>
    But nothing was stuck anymore.<br/>
</p>

<p>And for the first time today, everything was going in the right direction.</p>
