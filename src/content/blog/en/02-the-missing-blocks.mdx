<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">🏛️ Arrival at the Venue — The Two Missing Blocks</h3>

<p class="font-body">The grand hall was a full-blown sensory assault—bright lights, stern judges, rolls of fabric stacked like skyscrapers, and rows of printing tables arranged with military precision. The energy buzzed; contestants were loudly, confidently unpacking their gear like seasoned magicians ready to reveal tricks.</p>

<p class="font-body">I spotted Buggy immediately.</p>

<p class="font-body">He was surrounded by a small crowd, proudly displaying his full set of ten exquisitely carved design blocks to his teammates and a couple of overly-interested journalists. The sight of his perfect, gleaming tools sent a familiar prickle of nerves skittering through me.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel leaned close to my ear, voice steady and reassuring.</p>

<p class="font-bod">
    <strong>
        "Don't worry, Novi. You have ten too. You're equally capable."
    </strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I managed a weak smile and reached for my leather pouch. My fingers expected the cool, familiar shapes of ten wooden blocks.</p>

<p class="font-body">Instead—</p>

<p class="font-body text-2xl text-accent-primary my-4"><strong>Shock. Silence. Panic.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">My hand closed around only two design blocks.</p>

<ul class="font-body list-disc ml-6">
    <li>One with a tiny dot-pattern.</li>
    <li>One with a short zig-zag.</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-body">The rest—my precious eight—were gone.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel immediately entered full diagnostic meltdown.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"This is unacceptable! We must report it! Statistically, you cannot win—two designs versus ten—this is a hard-loss condition!"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">A sinking weight settled in my stomach. Whether I'd misplaced them in the rush or someone had messed with my bag didn't matter anymore—time was already against me.</p>

<hr class="border-t-2 border-accent-primary my-8" />

<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">🔍 My Frantic Search</h3>

<p class="font-body">I tuned Kernel out and launched into a chaotic, borderline embarrassing search.</p>

<p class="font-body">I looked everywhere:</p>

<ul class="font-body list-disc ml-6">
    <li>under the tables</li>
    <li>behind curtains</li>
    <li>inside every pocket</li>
    <li>dumping my entire bag onto the floor</li>
    <li>checking compartments I forgot even existed</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-body">Each failed attempt made me feel more unhinged.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel, ever the painfully logical human calculator, remarked:</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Statistically, repeating a failed search procedure will not change the result."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">"Kernel, NOT NOW!" I hissed, barely holding it together.</p>

<p class="font-body">I grabbed my phone and texted my most organized friend:</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Hey can you bring 8 design blocks to the venue NOW?? Any design?? Anything?? Pls pls"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">Her reply was instant and laced with pure judgment:</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Why do you think I own fabric-printing design blocks???"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I threw my head back, letting the ceiling blur into one big glowing regret.</p>

<p class="font-body">Next, I attacked instant delivery apps with desperate precision:</p>

<ul class="font-body list-disc ml-6">
    <li>"pattern stamp"</li>
    <li>"cloth printing design blocks"</li>
    <li>"block printing tool urgent"</li>
    <li>"any stamp pls pls pls express delivery???"</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-body">Every search returned the same mocking message:</p>

<p class="font-mono text-lg text-status-error my-2">No matching items found.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel, irritatingly calm again:</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Novi, we should report this. This is a solvable governance problem."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">"Kernel, stop talking like a helpdesk!"</p>

<p class="font-body">In a final act of desperation, I picked up random objects from backstage: a bottle cap, a keychain, a metal clip, a sad rubber band. I inked and pressed them, praying for even the faintest usable pattern.</p>

<p class="font-body">Nope. Each attempt was a new flavour of disappointment.</p>

<p class="font-body">Finally, I collapsed into a chair, mind spinning, voice reduced to a cracked whisper:</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Why is this happening today…"</strong>
</p>

<hr class="border-t-2 border-accent-primary my-8" />

<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">💡 The Binary Breakthrough</h3>

<p class="font-body">Exhausted and soaked in invisible stress-sweat, I stumbled down a narrow backstage corridor and slumped against a wall. The distant roar of the crowd and the confident thud-thud-thud of Buggy starting his design sounded like a countdown to my doom.</p>

<p class="font-body">Then it happened.</p>

<p class="font-body">A literal lightbulb moment.</p>

<p class="font-body">Someone in the adjacent gallery flicked a switch, and a bright spotlight hit a framed piece of abstract art.</p>

<p class="font-body">I froze.</p>

<p class="font-body">The pattern—simple shapes repeating, expanding, spiraling into complexity—pulled me out of my despair like a hand reaching through fog.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel, hovering like my worried shadow, asked softly:</p>

<p class="font-body">
   <strong>"Novi…?"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I didn't look away from the artwork.</p>

<p class="font-body">A slow, incredulous smile crept onto my face.</p>

<p class="font-body ">
    "That's it.<br/>
    This isn't created from abundance…<br/>
    It's created from base + position.<br/>
    Decimal does it.<br/>
    Binary does it.<br/>
    Base isn't the limit — the strategy is."
</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel tilted his head, deeply concerned.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    "Binary? Are we discussing computation now? This is a fabric competition, Novi. You must focus."
</p>

<p class="font-body">I ignored him completely, adrenaline washing over panic.</p>

<p class="font-body text-lg">
    "Buggy is working in decimal, Kernel.<br/>
    But I…<br/>
    I will go binary!<br/>
    This is a philosophical leap—from the mundane to the exponential!"

</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel's worry escalated.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    "Novi, you are not making sense. Also, they are calling the finalists on stage!"
</p>

<p class="font-body">I whispered, half to myself:</p>

<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"Yes… dot dot, dot zigzag, zigzag dot, zigzag zigzag…"</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel tried to say something else, but I was already moving.</p>

<p class="font-body">I grabbed my pouch, secured the two lonely design blocks, and walked toward the stage—</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>
        heart pounding, mind buzzing,<br/>
        ready to attempt the impossible.
    </strong>
</p>

<hr class="border-t-2 border-accent-primary my-8" />

<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">😨 Kernel's One-Minute Catastrophe</h3>

<p class="font-body">(Meanwhile, on Kernel's side…)</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel had a bad feeling. The kind of bad feeling that settled into the stomach like a poorly documented bug and refused to leave. He hurried from backstage to the audience rows, weaving through people until he found a seat with a clear view of the stage.</p>

<p class="font-body">What he saw made his heart drop.</p>

<p class="font-body">Novi stood dead center under the harsh white lights—completely still.</p>

<ul class="font-body list-none ml-1">
<li>Not adjusting her tools.</li>
<li>Not greeting the judges.</li>
<li>Not beginning her design.</li>
<li>Just… frozen.</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-body">Muttering something to herself.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel leaned forward, straining to hear.</p>
 
<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"…dot dot… dot zigzag… zigzag dot… exponential leap…"</p>

<p class="font-body">"What on earth…" he whispered, burying his face in his hands.</p>

<p class="font-body">The judges exchanged worried looks.</p>

<p class="font-body">Buggy smirked like someone already drafting his victory speech.</p>

<p class="font-body">The audience began to shift and whisper.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel cringed so hard his shoulders folded inward.</p>

<p class="font-body text-status-error">This is it. This is the meltdown. She's gone full abstract philosophy in front of a live audience.</p>

<p class="font-body">A whole minute of complete stillness passed.</p>

<p class="font-body">A whole minute.</p>

<p class="font-body">In competitive time, that was eternity.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel could no longer sit there. His embarrassment was now so intense that his entire spine felt like it was retreating into itself. He stood up abruptly.</p>

<p class="font-body">He was going backstage.</p>

<p class="font-body">Someone had to gently guide Novi off before she became a metaphor in someone's TED talk about public breakdowns.</p>

<p class="font-body">But just as he turned—</p>

<p class="font-body">Novi moved.</p>

<p class="font-body">And Kernel froze.</p>

<p class="font-body">Her hand dipped into the ink. Stamp.</p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>Dot—clean, sharp, confident.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">Then the second block. Stamp.</p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>Zigzag.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body"><strong>Then both—rapid, fluid combinations that seemed impossible for someone carrying the weight of panic moments ago. Dot-dot. Dot-zig. Zig-dot. Zig-zig. Over and over—each sequence forming a new, distinct motif.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body text-status-success"><strong>Rhythmic. Deliberate.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">Like she wasn't designing but composing.</p>

<p class="font-body">The audience gasped.</p>

<p class="font-body">The judges leaned so far forward one nearly lost her balance.</p>

<p class="font-body">Buggy stopped mid-stamp, disbelief cracking across his face.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel slowly sat back down, his mouth falling open.</p>

<p class="font-body">Eight missing design blocks.</p>

<p class="font-body">Two tiny tools.</p>

<p class="font-body">And Novi was creating more variation, more depth, more originality than he had ever seen—even in her best rehearsals.</p>

<p class="font-body">His embarrassment dissolved, replaced by an unexpected prickle of awe rising up his neck.</p>

![Novi's Design](../../../assets/02-the-missing-blocks-novis-design.png)

<p class="font-body"><strong>Novi wasn't frozen.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body"><strong>She wasn't panicking.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>She was computing.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>She was planning.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>She was… about to change the game.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel let out a long breath, equal parts relief and astonishment.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"This girl,"</strong> he whispered under his breath, shaking his head,
    <strong>"is going to give me grey hair."</strong>
</p>

<hr class="border-t-2 border-accent-primary my-8" />

<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">🧩 Backstage — The Partial Reveal</h3>

<p class="font-body">From my side, right after stepping off stage…</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel practically jogged backstage the moment I stepped off. His internal systems must have been a mess—I could practically feel the spiritual overheating from that eternal minute of silence followed by the wild pattern blitz he'd just witnessed.</p>

<p class="font-body">I was calmly wiping ink off my fingers, serene and satisfied. Kernel, however, looked like he'd sprinted through seven existential crises simultaneously.</p>

<p class="font-body">He marched straight up to me.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Novi. Explain. Now."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I blinked innocently. "Explain what?"</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel gestured wildly toward the stage.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"The— the THING you just did! That pattern explosion! You had TWO design blocks! Two! You shouldn't have been able to create that many variations unless you—"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">He paused.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"—were secretly possessed."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I snorted. "Kernel, please. If I were possessed, the pattern would've been symmetrical."</p>

<p class="font-body">"Then WHAT was it?" he demanded.</p>

<p class="font-body">I leaned back against the wall, clutching my ink-stained pouch.</p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary text-lg"><strong>"Binary."</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel blinked. "Binary… as in… computer binary? Like 0 and 1? Novi, this is a textile competition. You didn't hack the fabric."</p>

<p class="font-body">"Actually," I said, grinning, "I kind of did."</p>

<p class="font-body">He stared.</p>

<p class="font-body">I sighed and held up the two design blocks.</p>

<p class="font-body">"This one is dot. This one is zig-zag," I said.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Two symbols, Kernel. Just two."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel folded his arms. "I'm aware of the count."</p>

<p class="font-body">"And two symbols are enough," I said.</p>

<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"Dot-dot."</p>

<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"Dot-zig."</p>

<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"Zig-dot."</p>

<p class="font-mono text-base text-support-tertiary">"Zig-zig."</p>

<p class="font-body">I tapped each block lightly, like demonstrating a magic trick.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Four patterns with just two symbols. And if you repeat sequences…"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I shrugged.</p>

<p class="font-body text-support-tertiary"><strong>"…you get infinite possibilities.</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">Because every time you repeat the sequence, you're not adding a symbol—you're adding a position. And positions are limitless."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel's eyebrows shot up. "Wait. That was Binary? You used Binary for fabric printing?"</p>

<p class="font-body">I nodded. "Yup."</p>

<p class="font-body">"That's… absurd!"</p>

<p class="font-body">"But effective," I said sweetly.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel opened his mouth, closed it, then opened it again.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"I don't understand fully," he admitted, rubbing his forehead.
    "How did you know where to place them? How did you sequence them? And how—"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I placed a finger on his lips.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Kernel," I said, smiling,</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"That's the partial explanation. You'll get the rest at home.
    Right now—"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I lifted my ink-stained hands.</p>

<p class="font-body">"—I need soap. And a snack. Possibly seven."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel nodded, intrigued and overwhelmed.</p>

<p class="font-body">And he knew one thing for certain:</p>

<p class="font-body"><strong>Whatever I'd pulled off on that stage…</strong></p>

<p class="font-body">he hadn't even seen half the truth yet.</p>

<hr class="border-t-2 border-accent-primary my-8" />

<h3 class="font-heading text-xl text-neutral-dark">🏠 At Home — The Full Reveal & The Strategy Behind Infinity</h3>

<p class="font-body">By the time we reached home, the adrenaline had drained out of my system and transformed into pure exhaustion. I tossed my ink-stained pouch onto the table, kicked off my shoes, and collapsed onto the couch like a deflated origami crane.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel followed me in, still wearing the same expression he'd worn backstage—the "I will not sleep until I understand" face.</p>

<p class="font-body">He set two glasses of water on the table.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Novi," he said, sitting beside me,
    "I've been patient. But now I need the full explanation. No more poetic half-answers. What happened today?"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I groaned dramatically, lifted one hand, and pointed to the ceiling.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Kernel, bring me the whiteboard."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel sighed.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"You don't need a whiteboard—"</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Kernel."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"…I'll bring the whiteboard."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">He dragged over the small foldable board I use for late-night brainstorming. I sat up, cracked my knuckles, and drew two big symbols:</p>

<div class="font-mono text-lg bg-accent-muted border-2 border-accent-primary/40 text-left px-4">
    <p><strong> • (dot)</strong></p>
    <p><strong> /// (zigzag)</strong></p>
</div>

<p class="font-body">"These," I said, "are my 0 and 1."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel nodded slowly.</p>

<p class="font-body">I continued.</p>

<p class="font-body">"You saw me randomly stamping? That wasn't random. I was creating sequences."</p>

<p class="font-body">I wrote:</p>

<div class="font-mono text-xl my-4 p-4 bg-neutral-light border-l-4 border-status-success">
    dot dot <br/>
    dot zig <br/>
    zig dot <br/>
    zig zig
</div>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Two design blocks → four patterns.<br/>
    Add one more repetition → eight.<br/>
    Then sixteen.<br/>
    Then thirty-two.<br/>
    Exponential growth."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel leaned back, lips parted slightly.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Binary in fabric… I still can't believe you did that on the fly."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I shrugged. "Binary is just… comforting. Two choices. Infinite possibilities, as long as you use the positional strategy."</p>

<p class="font-body">Then I drew three columns:</p>

<div class="overflow-x-auto my-6 font-body">
    <table class="w-full text-left border border-support-muted">
        <thead class="bg-accent-muted">
            <tr>
                <th class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-heading">Binary</th>
                <th class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-heading">Octal</th>
                <th class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-heading">Hexadecimal</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-mono text-support-tertiary">Base 2 (0, 1)</td>
                <td class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-mono text-support-tertiary">Base 8 (0-7)</td>
                <td class="p-3 border border-support-muted font-mono text-support-tertiary">Base 16 (0-F)</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p class="font-body">"Binary is the simplest.</p>

<p class="font-body">If I had eight design blocks?</p>

<p class="font-body">That's like switching to Octal."</p>

<p class="font-body">I held up eight fingers.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Eight symbols → even more combinations ($8^n$).</p>

<p class="font-body">The base changes the efficiency, not the infinity."</p>

<p class="font-body">"Sixteen design blocks?" Kernel guessed.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Hexadecimal," I grinned.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Sixteen symbols.</p>

<p class="font-body">Everything becomes super-efficient.</p>

<p class="font-body">That's why programmers love it."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel stared, amazed.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"You're telling me number systems aren't about quantity. They're about structure."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">"Yes!" I slapped the table, delighted.</p>

<p class="font-body">"That's the point! Buggy worked in decimal thinking. He saw ten design blocks as ten individual options.</p>

<p class="font-body">I had two design blocks and used strategy, not quantity."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel sat quietly, absorbing.</p>

<p class="font-body">I softened my tone.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Look, Kernel… this is true in life too."</p>

<p class="font-body">I put the marker down and folded my hands.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Sometimes we look at someone else and think they have more—more tools, more opportunities, more advantages."</p>

<p class="font-body">I pointed at the board.</p>

<p class="font-body">"But they might just be using a system we don't understand yet."</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel's eyes lifted to mine.</p>

<p class="font-body">"We think they're infinite," I continued, "but they're not. They're just applying a pattern. A method. A strategy."</p>

<p class="font-body">I leaned back into the couch cushion.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"When we learn that strategy—binary, octal, hex, whatever—suddenly… we aren't limited anymore.
    We realize we didn't need more resources.
    We needed more perspective."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">A small smile tugged at Kernel's lips.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"And today," he said softly,
    "You showed that two design blocks can stand against ten."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">I laughed gently.</p>

<p class="font-body">"Kernel, two design blocks can stand against anything if you use them right."</p>

<p class="font-body">We sat there for a moment, a gentle silence settling between us.</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel exhaled, somewhere between admiration and exhaustion.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Well," he murmured, "that explains the grey hair."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">"Good," I said brightly.</p>

<p class="font-body">
    <strong>"Because tomorrow? We're trying imaginary numbers."</strong>
</p>

<p class="font-body">Kernel groaned into a pillow.</p>

<p class="font-body">But he was smiling.</p>
