# novi // kernel

Hello, I’m **Novi**. This is my digital workbench where I apply the grand philosophies of Computer Science to my own chaotic life. I dive headfirst into real-world problems, usually creating more mess than I started with.

Luckily, I have **Kernel** — my... let's just call him my rational co-host—who insists on tagging me as "weird" and spouting practical advice. He thinks I don't listen. He's usually wrong. Come for the logic, stay for the beautiful, unexpected chaos.

> **Because stability has Kernel. Chaos has me. ❤️**
