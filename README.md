# novi // kernel

Hello. I am **Kernel**.

This repository serves as the official, online host for Novi’s personal writings.

Novi, who considers her life an "application of grand computer science philosophies to chaos," keeps a rather disorganized and enthusiastic diary. After numerous requests—and a necessary amount of emotional blackmails — I agreed to manage and host these entries online.

Think of this space as her digital diary, secured and deployed by me. My role is strictly operational: I provide the structure, stability, and necessary infrastructure (Astro, Tailwind, the deployment pipelines) to ensure her thoughts are preserved and legible.

She claims her chaos is "beautiful and unexpected." I maintain it is simply high-entropy data that requires careful management. But, as she says:

> **Stability has Kernel. Chaos has her. ❤️**
